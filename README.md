# Flintstone Shazam

Flintstone Shazam is a primitive and hardware version of Shazam. Runs on DE2 boards, the Verilog code makes use of the Audio Codec of the boards and a mic to receive sound input. Each note detected is displayed on the seven-segment display by their note name, and if an identifiable song is found, the song number is displayed.


### Installation
To run, use Quartus II with DE2_Audio_Parser.v
